# nmcli-rofi

A simple manager for network connections using [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) and 
[nmcli](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/nmcli.1). 
Strongly inspired/based on [rofi-wifi-menu](https://github.com/zbaylin/rofi-wifi-menu). 
Most of the code (I would say all code) was copied from the original creator. 
I've only refactored the code to improve performance and easily add new features.
